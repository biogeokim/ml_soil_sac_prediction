# `ml_soil_sac_prediction`
Common machine learning models and spatial autocorrelation in soil-geomorphic modeling of four regional soil datasets

# Prerequisite
- `git`
- R
- R integrated development environment (e.g., Posit RStudio, VSCode-R, etc.)

# Usage
- In a terminal, type:
```{shell}
git clone https://github.com/biogeokim/ml_soil_sac_prediction
cd ml_soil_sac_prediction
Rscript ./Code/0_Run_me.r
```
- or using VSCode or RStudio (soon to be Posit), you can navigate through all the objects that will be produced with codes:
```{shell}
git clone https://github.com/biogeokim/ml_soil_sac_prediction
```
  - Then open VSCode or Posit RStudio and set the working directory as `ml_soil_sac_prediction`
  - Open `./Code/0_Run_me.r`
  - Run line by line
